      <h2>Alzheimer's Association</h2>
      <p> The <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_1973.asp">Alzheimer's Association</a> is a
      charity that is bringing awareness to the degenerative mind disease called Alzheimers. Alzheimers is
      a disease that affects the brain, causing the afflicted to lose memory capacity, some thinking
      ability, and causes a change in their behavior. The most common form of Alzheimers is dementia,
      however, Alzheimer's Association stresses that this is not a common thing that happens along
      with aging. Some symptons to look out for of Alzheimer patients are memory loss that disrupt daily life,
      challenges in planning or solving problems, confusion with time or place, and etc.</p>
